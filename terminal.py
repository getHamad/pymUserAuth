    This "Block" facilitates the creation of a new account within the authenticator system.

    In detail:
        1. A request code is generated and the user must input the correct code to proceed.
        2. The user is prompted to enter their username, password, first name, last name, date of birth, and gender.
        3. Various validations are performed to ensure the correctness of the entered data.
        4. If all inputs are valid, a new user account is created and a record is inserted to the database through class "User".
