def databaseConnection() -> MongoClient:
    """
    Establish a connection to the MongoDB database using the connection string provided in the .env file.

    Steps:
    1. Retrieve the database connection string from the .env file.
    2. Attempt to connect to the MongoDB database using the connection string.
    3. Verify the database connection.

    Returns:
        MongoClient: The MongoClient object if the connection is successful.
        None: If the connection or authentication fails.

    Raises:
        ConnectionFailure: If there is a failure in acquiring the database connection.
        OperationFailure: If the authentication with the database fails.
        Exception: If an unexpected error occurs.

    Notes:
    - This function hides the database connection details from the main code, enhancing security and control.
    - Import this function in your main or index.py file to establish a database connection.

    FAQ:
    Q: Why are we using this method?
    A: To hide the key & database connection details from the main code, enhancing overall database control in the code.
    
    Q: How can I import the database?
    A: Use the "import" method in your index/main .py file to import the databaseConnection() function.
    
    Q: Do I need to import any other function for the key?
    A: No, as long as the key is present in the .env file, you don't need to import any other function.
